Story:
I wanted to scan all my books. Some scan services ask me to tell them "how many pages?" for charges.

So, I decided to use google books to figure out book length.
http://books.google.co.jp/books

1) Scan bar code with bar code reader to get ISBNs.

2) Register all ISBNs to google books, example:
http://books.google.com/books?uid=109354444701174183837&as_coll=1002&source=gbs_lp_bookshelf_list

3) Export XML file(s) via Options.
4) Obtain CSV file(s) with length data using this script, python run.py *.xml
5) Print CSV file(s) and put it on box.

Have happy digital life!
